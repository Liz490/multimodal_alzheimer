# ADLM ADNI

ADNI is a rich dataset designed to track Alzheimers and potential Alzheimers patients across the US. 3D Brain MRI scans as well as protein-indicating PET scans are used to measure the biological state of the patient in addition to genetic testing, general demographic information, blood biomarkers and cognitive tests.

Much research focuses on creating the best possible model with only one source of data, often leaving a lot of useful information unnecessarily on the table. With so much information from many different sources available, we are interested in investigating how best to combine these pools of information to achieve the best possible classification of Alzheimers disease state. Focus will be on how to optimally combine different modalities, taking care not to encode the same information multiple times while allowing correlations and interactions between data sources to be learned.

# Setup

## Environment
Install the project environment with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
afterwards you will be able to use it with
```
conda activate adni
```

If you install new stuff and want to commit code that requires it, update the environment with
```
conda env export -f environment.yml --no-builds
```

## MedicalNet
A copy of MedicalNet including all pretrained models is stored in the shared project folder under
`/vol/chameleon/projects/adni/adni_1/MedicalNet`. If you want to execute code depending on 
MedicalNet add 
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/vol/chameleon/projects/adni/adni_1/"
```
to your `~/.bashrc` (or other shell configuration).
Log out and log in again in order to make changes take effect.
You can test the configuration with
```
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```
The output should contain `/vol/chameleon/projects/adni/adni_1/`.
You can then just use it like any normal module with
```
from MedicalNet import ...
```

**Important: Do not change code in the MedicalNet repository!** If you need to do stuff differently
than them, create a new file in our repository and load the modules you need.

## Automatic ssh authentification for download script usage
Add to your ssh config (~/.ssh/config):
```
Host adlm 
  HostName 131.159.110.3 
  User <YOUR_USERNAME>
```

Connect to the AIMED VPN.
Add your public key to authkeys on the server:
```
you@your_computer:~$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE> adlm
```

Now you can login with 
```
ssh adlm
``` 
if you are connected to the VPN and use the download script for tabular data.

# Usage

After setting up automatic ssh authentification you can download tabular data by running 
```
./download_tabular.sh
```

Run any (python-)scripts from the project root directory, otherwise you will get errors
due to wrong path configuration.

Make sure to delete cell outputs in jupyter notebooks before staging/committing.
